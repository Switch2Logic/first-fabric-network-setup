# first-fabric-network-setup
I am a masters student learning Hyperledger Fabric. This little single orginazation using namespace hospital1.switch2logic makes use of 4 peer, 1 Ordererer, 1 CA and a fabric-clint. The biggest problems I have been facing is with Docker. I understand now if you want to start with Hyperledger Fabric you need a firm understanding of docker and its networking to get a mutiple host up and running.
